# A tiny Swing tutorial

no i dare not say it is even a tutorial, more like a very very
basic introduction...

![evidence that my classmates at least had the chance to
  download this (it's their fault if they didn't mwahaha)](evi.jpg)

(also i remember trying to find a Stack Overflow question that addressed
the three components of a GUI program
(sort of went like "graphical composition" "updates?" "action listeners")
but couldn't find it again... just to let you know that (otherwise
this presentation would have been WAY more than just examples ---
i would've talked about the big overview of GUI programs if i could
find any sauce that i can base my stupid thoughts on...))

anyways to see PDFs generated run `make` or `make build`
(source document is in `swing-intro.md`)

you will need to have a lot of things installed tho, namely:

*   [pandoc][]
*   a TeX distribution ([TeX Live][], [MacTeX][], [MiKTeX][] to
    name a few) &mdash; make sure the command `pdflatex` works
*   a [Python 3][] distribution + [pygments][] (for the LaTeX package
    minted to work) &mdash; make sure the command `pygmentize` works
