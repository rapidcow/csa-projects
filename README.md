# APCSA stuff

stuff i wrote for my APCSA class of 2021-2022, uploaded for
educational purposes (and show-off >v>)

i wrote all the code EXCEPT parts of `blackjack/src/Driver2.java`
(that was from a template)
although this is for educational purposes, please credit me
if you want to use this in class or anything..... (a link
to <https://github.com/rapidcow/csa-projects> is okay)

(if you did, thank you! i hope whatever i wrote helps :D)

catalog:

*   `builder-pattern/`: a common design pattern where methods
    `return this` to allow chaining & specification of
    optional arguments in a readable fashion
*   `blackjack/`: a [Blackjack](https://www.blackjackinfo.com/blackjack-rules/)
    game that (d)evolved into sussy among us GUI
    (i might make a tutorial on the GUI but trust me it looks
    messy i likely don't even know how it works now)
*   `swing-tutorial/`: notes I made after an unprepared talk about
    Javax Swing (at my teacher's request --- I knew for sure
    nobody was gonna listen to me talk)
